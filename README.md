# Firebase Authentication with Email and Password

This repository contains code on how to setup authentication in a react native/expo project using email and password
I tried to make this as simple as posible as to not deviate from the purpose of the application.

## Disclaimer
It contains all API keys used in the video however I will advice against using in your project as it was created for learning purpose and not to used in an actual production environment, thus everyone is free to use but you should create yours as described in the video
